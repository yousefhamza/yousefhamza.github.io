My name is Yousef Hamza, I'm from Cairo, Egypt.

I'm self taught programmer, I do my programming now in Python for applying machine learning algorithms that I'm currently working in web development in Django
and Mobile Development in iOS and using Python for basically everything else
I'm also contributing to C++/C open-source projects and iOS projects on github ([My Github](https://github.com/yousefhamza))

I also love problem solving on online Judges like SPOJ, [CF](http://codeforces.com/profile/yousefhamza) and TC.
I'm a gamer whenever I have the time for it -mostly Dota 2 wink -
