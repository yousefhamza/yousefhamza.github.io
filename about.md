My name is Yousef Hamza, I'm an Engineering Manager at [Instabug](https://www.instabug.com/), I have been there all my career now since 2016. I started there as an iOS developer and helped ship many of the existing products.

I'm quite active on Twitter, sometimes in Arabic as I'm from Egypt, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jo_adam).
