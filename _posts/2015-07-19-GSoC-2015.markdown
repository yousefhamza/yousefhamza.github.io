Hey there all.

about a weak here's a sneak peak at the release note ;)

>   * French
>   * German
>   * Malay

> * View a list of currently active visits
> * Report bugs: Shake your device to open a bug reporter
> * iPad support: Now runs natively on iPad

Also this week I did some a quite good reading about XForms and I guess I have been lucky so far
I was really scared of it at the beginning of the program.

But now I have very good grasp of it that If I worked really hard I can finish it by the end of
this week!
I will post a screen shots in my next post.

Till then. CYA!
