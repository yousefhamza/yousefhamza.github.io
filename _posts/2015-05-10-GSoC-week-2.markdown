Well, It is not that big.

But just some stuff that came to mind the minute I first checked the code, It was hard to find the desired files, the
naming is fine but ALL the files were just flat the project navigator and there's lots of them (68).

so just re-organizing the files per function really helped clear the scene more.

The result:
![Project navigator image](/assests/project_navigator.png "Title")

So that was good,

Next came Travis CI, I have worked with projects using it and see how useful it can be but it was my first time trying
to deploy one. well and for iOS project that was not cool, Travis is Cool but I guess swift is not.

I wasted some good amounts of time trying to make it work with no luck like at all, I think that's due to that the language
is still in development and evolving with every version of xcode, so that still work in progress.

Last thing was adding a Codingstyle, that came to me when I was making some pull requests and Parker the current maintainer
pointed out he is using a spaces instead of tabs 'that were in my commits" so I suggested to add a simple Codingstyle file
for future contributes too.

That also involved making sure that existing code is following the same rules, so I managed to find a tool called "Artistic
Style" to do exactly that, I sat my options and it worked.

What's left is just fixing 2 JIRA tickets and making Travis work, hopefully I get this done by tuesday, Cause I must go
cool off before the finals this weekend!

Now I go finish my 7 pattern recognition experiments to deliver tomorrow, PEACE!
