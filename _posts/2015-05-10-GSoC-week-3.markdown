![Welcome package image](/assests/welcome_package.jpg "Title")

So this has been a pretty exciting week GSoC wise I have been able to finish most of the left over stuff form last week.

Travis in particular was really annoying even after it worked the new syntax changes was not available in Travis XCode
(version 6.1.1) So to finish this I have to make just the ugliest hack I think of all time, which is reverting the
new swift code updates before starting to work on it, and This actually works you can check the file here: [.travis.yml](https://github.com/Undo1/openmrs-contrib-ios-client/blob/master/.travis.yml)

Also I fixed all the JIRA Tickets available, I would encourage you if you are checking this to add more issues [there](https://issues.openmrs.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20IOS) :)

And finally my welcome package has arrived the pen looks pretty decent, the notebook not sure actually :D
My journey has been quite fun this week and I hope this continue :)
