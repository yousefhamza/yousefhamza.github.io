![GSoC 2015 image](/assests/openmrs.png "Title")
So, in my [proposal](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/iOS+Client+Extensions+Proposal) for this year for OpenMRS
I have listed some to-dos to work on the community bonding area to make the
development tasks later much easier, these tasks are:


- Add User experience enhancements.
- Finish Already existing TODOs in the codebase.
- Fixing JIRA tickets.
- Refactoring the code.
- Put a “CodingStyle” file for future contributors.
- Integrate the code base with Travis CI.
- Update the OpenMRS-iOS Development Guide.

This week I wasn't free like at all, but I managed to push some code to add User experience enhancements -was my most loved
part of this week <3- that I have experienced myself e.g.: No feedback in the search view, and clicking on the table cell highlight the cell but don't activate
the text field.

If you got any ideas or issues please create an issue [here](https://issues.openmrs.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20IOS)
or if you find that difficult you can just [email me](mailto:jo.adam.93@gmail.com) with a screen shot.

Always had a chance to surf the code to check for the TODOs I find there was only one for handling coredata error, but it's
serious and will work on it next week.
