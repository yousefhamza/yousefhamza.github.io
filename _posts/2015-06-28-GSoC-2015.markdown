So now we are in midterm evacuation period and I have successfully completed my TO-DOs so far
This week I spent most of it making bug fixes and better state handling and that's still ongoing process

The features added this week are not directly sensible but have a huge impact on user, and also added support for
other languages, for now German and French, next Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan and Malay.

Also got to started iPad views and animations and that will be done by next week.
Here's a taste of that:

Next after finishing iPad views I will be working on refactoring the code and using a framework to handle all forms
and better state handling to make not only the app bug proof but only to make the code safer.
