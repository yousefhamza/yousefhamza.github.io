PHEW!

What an exciting week!
Well, for a starter I took a very well deserved well worth it vacation for a couple of days in Alexandria with a couple of
friends that was actually pretty nice

But to the technical PART now Joe!
This week the work was pretty good I learned alot of stuff there explored the world of ObjC frameworks
and refactored serious parts of the code and used an amazing forms framework called XLForms check it out if you are
building any forms-oriented app.

Also took a little HEAD FIRST dive into testing and learned some concepts there to test the changes I made there to make the
code and I guess it's x2 safer now.
Note: If you are trying to stub your requests that you make in the app using AFNetworking use OHTTPStubs it's just have
a better support more than Nocilla.

And.. HOLLY MOLLY!
When I was trying to add remove offline records in the app I had to brush on some of my Coredata skills
I was able to tackle one of the MAJOR bugs.. Actually it's the biggest bug in the app! that caused it to crash at launch.

The app is now much better looking and also a much safer code!
