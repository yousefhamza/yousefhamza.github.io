Well After finishing tons of work that last week Which me myself thought it was week 3, it looked like I made a miscalculation
there which put even more work upon my shoulders and it looks like it will be that way until the midterm evaluation always
working even on week ends :/.

Anyway that last week part was really tricky and made me release even more the necessity of Software Design/Architecture
and how important is that for software development, good design could save TONS of time.

It was about editing the patients on the app on one hand and then if offline syncing them back online, there was 2 tricky
parts there the data model in the application wasn't perfectly matching the one on the server and also the fact that forms
just don't belong to the Mobile.

That resulted some hardcoding which I paid for it later when I added support for other languages to seperate between the model
and the view text representation.

Also Today I just added State restoration that was kinda easy but lot's of tedious work and Raise one more flag for the need
for more organization and resusability needed in the code.
