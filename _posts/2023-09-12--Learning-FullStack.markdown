When I started my career at Instabug 7 years ago, I was not yet sure what career to pursue, as a software developer, should I learn FE or BE? should I learn Python or Ruby?

3 months before I have started my position as full time iOS developer at Instabug, I was a BE intern at another company. I wouldn't have even applied if it wasn't for the recruiter that contacted me on LinkedIn (Thanks Donia üôå).

# My life as an iOS developer

When I want to start an iOS app, I open Xcode, I have many templates to choose from, the app is runnable already, there‚Äôs unit tests and UI tests setup available, I can release it with a couple of clicks.

# Programming as a hobby

In the last 6 weeks, I picked up coding as a hobby, I just love it and I miss it so much since I became an Engineering Manager.

And as a hobby I started to pick a project that would expose me to as many things as possible. In the first 2 days, I was already overwhelemed with the choices to make:

1. Which language to use
2. Which framework to use
3. How should I setup my project?
4. Which build system I should choose?
5. Which package manager to use?
6. Which testing framework to use?
7. I need to read .env file? Install a package for that
8. I need to route to multiple pages in my react app? Which framework to use?
9. I‚Äôm done, how to ‚Äúrelease‚Äù?
10. Just upload it somewhere and run it?
11. How can I make sure only I can upload it?
12. Want to persist data? What DB to use? Which package to accces it from node?
13. How to handle DB migrations?

# Are you done? Now feel bad about it

I‚Äôm not done with the project yet, by in the meantime, but I have learned that:

1. react sucks
2. the way I created react (create react app) sucks
3. bun 1.0 is out and now node sucks.

# Reflection

Looking back to the first days of my career, these choices paralyzed me! I spent a lot of time trying to _*decide*_ what to learn, instead of learning it.

The iOS development setup was so simple I spent a lot of time actually doing it that I have accidently gained enough experience to land a very sweet job at a company that I considered too prestigious to even apply.
