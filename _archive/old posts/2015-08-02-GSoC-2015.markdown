Hey there!

We reached a very important and very last milestone in this GSoC which is uploading a form that's filled on the 
iOS client for OpenMRS :)

What's left is implementing a second view for it although that seems really really useless.. and testing Binary types
And last but not least write some migration code for Coredata!

Will share some pics in the next post.
