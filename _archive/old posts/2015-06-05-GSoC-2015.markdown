I'm having a very very stressful time, I'm in the middle of brutal Final exams schedule maximum 3 days between any 2 exams
and my courses this semester are not making it any easier (Cryptography, Pattern recognition, Computer Graphics, AI)

Hopefully all this will be done soon!

Now to GSoC, I'm right on schedule in my [proposal](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/iOS+Client+Extensions+Proposal)
but due to very busy mind I forgot to complete my weekly feedback and I'm now 2 missed feedback forms away from being kicked
which is really sad since I already done my work on time.

Anyway this 2 weeks included adding active visits to the app, also adding a batter patient view which included adding a handful
of images this was my first time dealing with images and handling it's size in iOS application but it was a nice experience
but raise the need for a tool to handle that which I think already there I just have to look

So pull the new updates when merged and tell me what you think!
and Let me know if you had any suggestions or feedback here: [email](mailto:jo.adam.93@gmail.com)
