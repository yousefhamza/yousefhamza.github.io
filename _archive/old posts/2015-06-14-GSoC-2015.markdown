Starting this week real work begins.
I will be working on OpenMRS app full time and hope the next few weeks will be a huge improvement.

About this week:
The expected output of this week is adding the Patient edit functionality to the app, but with the ability to edit even offline
 patients offline and sync them when the user go online again and this is the tricky part But I think I got it now will try
 to post full details of the task when done.
