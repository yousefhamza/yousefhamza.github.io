Hey there!

Fot the last week I have been working on implementing a solution for XForms, And things have been
going really really great that it's just about done!

My implementation has support for almost all the types on the server has a client side checking
and has in my experience a nicer interface!

The model and controller and views is done, Now I will work on uploading and that's it!

you will be able to check it out soon as I will upload a video for it in my next post!
