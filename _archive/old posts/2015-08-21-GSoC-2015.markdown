Hello again. :)

That's my last post about GSoC this one is to demonstrate the new release:

The new features:

* Rewritten Login view with a separate button for login to demo server
* New settings icon in the mainmenu
* Adding more information there, like the OpenMRS server URL and a link to the project page
* Also added refreshing timer that you can configure to refresh the patient data when it's open on the device
* Added XForms support
  * User can view available xforms to fill
  * User can save the xforms to fill where there's not internet connection
  * User can open XForms and fill it from the App with 2 UI choices that you can choose from the settings
  * User can submit XForms from the app to edit encounters for that patient on server
  * User can view the XForm used to edit encounter from the app -If the encounter is set by an XForms-
  * When no internet connection, user can save the filled forms offline to send them later when he has internet connection
* Better handling for all the network errors across the app
* Adding a new Activity indicators all across the app

Here's a video to demonstrate the XForms functionality: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvSRoguIdNs)
