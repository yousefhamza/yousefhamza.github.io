GSoC 2013 no, GSoC 2014 no, GSoC 2015 YEAAAAAAAAS!

This year was my third attempt to participate in summer of code, I want to start by saying that this program really helped
me develop my skills since my first attempt.

and actually looking back at my history applying for the program I can see what went wrong, and let me deliver that experience
to you.

## GSoC 2013

Well, everything was so wrong in my first year applying :D.

I didn't know anything about source version control, my programming skills was so modest, I had no idea what building a
project means that wasn't even in my dictionary, I couldn't use the terminal for anything like at all.

And the biggest flaw due to the absence of all this knowledge, I had a wrong estimate of the size of the project I'm applying to.
I was applying for the C++ library Boost. enough said I guess?

Anyway that year my goal wasn't to get into the program I knew I wasn't ready but I wanted to get a taste of what it's like
and I can say that year got that job done.

## GSoC 2014

I learnt a lot from GSoC 2014, I became better programmer I started using Git I started using the command line for more stuff
and to be fair I had a really good chance that year, the lack of preparation is what stopped me from advancing, the orgnaization
I applied for that year was Subsurface it's a divelog desktop application written in C/C++ with Qt, my project was to build their
iOS app.

But the organization required that every student has to submit 2 patches for the project before submitting a proposal, and
well I had 0 experience doing that, so It took a lot of time to do that and it was exciting to see my first contribution
but it took me lots of time that I had to submit the proposal just couple of hours before the deadline..

So that killed my chances.

## GSoC 2015

I learnt lessons from the previous 2 years I'm more confident I'm aware of how the process goes, but I was about to make a mistake
again this year but fortunately I realised it before it's too late.

This mistake was trying to make a proposal for multiple projects, I thought that was increasing my chances but soon I realised
my time was being wasted with no real progress, but as I started working 2 weeks earlier than the official starting date,
I realised that early enough. wuff!

So I chose to focus on OpenMRS-iOS app extensions I have huge confidence in my skills to do project since I already worked
on some iOS apps and contributed to open-source iOS apps too, so I managed to get a couple of pull requests merged early.

Then I started working on the proposal and I made sure to make as much UI mock ups as I can "and you should do the same if
you area applying for a project that invloves UI" and my mentors seemed to like it, like it Enough to accept me to work on
this project as a part of summer of code!

## Looking forward to summer!

I'm really excited to go through this experience this summer, I never worked did a 'real' full time job before so I'm looking
forward to really try that, I'm considering trying to go to a co-working space to like get the real experience, also the project
is really exciting and challenging and that's really exciting.

Can't wait!
